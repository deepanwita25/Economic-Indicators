There are lot of times when Economic Indicators like GDP play a very important role in business decision making.

In this project, I have collected GDP data for the countries from IMF.
The purpose of the project is to provide a guide on following:
- How to collect data through API from IMF
- How the GDP data should be represented through graphs in the dashboard such that people gain insights from it

Dashboard should be read as follows:

- Bubble chart: Shows what is the current GDP of different countries
- Column Chart: Select the year based on the requirement to see which are the top 5 countries in terms of GDP for the respective year
- Line Chart: It shows the time series data. By default, top 5 countries in terms of GDP in 2025 are shown. Based on one's requirement you can add or remove countries from the slicer on the right hand corner

This project demonstrates:
- ETL
- Data visualization in Power BI
- Pandas for data transformation
- Automation of data collection through scripts in IMF
